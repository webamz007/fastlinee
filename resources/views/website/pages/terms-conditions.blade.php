                <p class="text-center">
                    The above prices are in Saudi Riyal and are inclusive of VAT. All rates are subject to change without prior notice at any time. Individual trip rates will be used for any non-complete round trip or if changes were made after the allowed change time.

In case of Non-comfort/Cancellation/Amendments:

With 24 hours prior to the trip time, a penalty of the full sector cost will be applied.
Within 48 hours prior to the trip time, a penalty of 50% of the sector change will be applied.
The maximum waiting time is 20 minutes after the scheduled time and 90 minutes at the Airport as per the scheduled flight arrival time. After that, clients will be considered as No-Show, and the full charge is applied, and the trip will be canceled.

If Fastlinee cannot deliver the service for a trip for any reason, only the affected sector will be canceled.

Fastlinee will not be held responsible for any other circumstances or delays. Fastlinee shall not hold any liability for any baggage or items left in the vehicle after drop-off.

Any damage caused by passengers to the vehicle's interior or exterior will result in immediate charges of the trip's cost or more, based on the damage done. If passengers refuse to pay such charges, the agent who made the reservation is obliged to pay them to Fastlinee.

Smoking is strictly prohibited inside the vehicle. Otherwise, a charge of 500 SAR must be paid by the passenger. If the passenger refuses to pay such charges, the agent who made the reservation is obliged to pay them to Fastlinee.
